# milkdrop2-musikcube
a port of the amazing milkdrop2 visualizer to musikcube

most of the code was pulled straight from the [official Milkdrop2 source code](https://sourceforge.net/projects/milkdrop2/), but some was adapted from the [XBMC plugin](https://github.com/oO-MrC-Oo/Milkdrop2-XBMC).

you'll need the [directx 9 sdk](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=6812) to compile this plugin.
